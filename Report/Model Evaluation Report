# Model Evaluation Report
## Home Price Prediction Project

## 1. Objective
The objective of this report is to evaluate the performance of regression models
used for predicting house prices and select the best-performing model.

---

## 2. Models Implemented
The following regression models were trained and tested:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression

---

## 3. Evaluation Metrics
To measure model performance, the following metrics were used:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** – Measures average squared prediction error
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** – Measures average absolute error
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** – Penalizes large errors
- **R² Score** – Measures how well features explain price variance

---

## 4. Model Performance Analysis

### Linear Regression
- Provided baseline performance
- Showed signs of slight overfitting
- Performance gap observed between training and testing data

---

### Ridge Regression
- Reduced overfitting using L2 regularization
- Improved generalization on test data
- Stable coefficient values

---

### Lasso Regression
- Applied L1 regularization
- Reduced model complexity by shrinking some coefficients to zero
- Helped in feature selection

---

## 5. Overfitting & Underfitting Check
- Linear Regression: Mild overfitting
- Ridge Regression: Balanced bias-variance tradeoff
- Lasso Regression: Slightly higher bias but better interpretability

---

## 6. Best Model Selection
Ridge and Lasso Regression models performed better than Linear Regression.
Among them, the model with:
- Lower RMSE
- Higher R² Score

was selected as the final model.

---

## 7. Business Interpretation
- The model predicts house prices with acceptable accuracy
- Useful for real estate valuation and decision-making
- Helps reduce manual estimation errors

---

## 8. Final Conclusion
Regularization techniques significantly improved model stability and performance.
The final model is reliable for predicting house prices on unseen data.
