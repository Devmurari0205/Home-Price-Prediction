# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Home Price Prediction Project

## 1. Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure, quality,
and patterns present in the housing dataset. This step helps identify missing values,
outliers, and important relationships between features and house prices.

## 2. Dataset Overview
- Dataset Type: Real Estate Housing Data
- Number of Records: Based on CSV file
- Target Variable: **Price**
- Feature Types:
  - Numerical: Rooms, Distance, Bedroom2, Bathroom, Car, Landsize, BuildingArea
  - Categorical: Suburb, Type, Method, Regionname, SellerG

---

## 3. Data Understanding
- Printed column names to understand available features
- Used descriptive statistics to analyze mean, median, min, max, and distribution
- Identified columns irrelevant for price prediction

---

## 4. Missing Value Analysis
- Checked missing values column-wise
- Observed missing data in:
  - Distance
  - Bedroom2
  - Bathroom
  - Car
  - Landsize
  - BuildingArea
- Missing values can negatively affect model accuracy if not handled properly

---

## 5. Data Cleaning
### Dropped Columns
The following columns were removed because they do not directly contribute to
price prediction or introduce unnecessary noise:
- Address
- Date
- YearBuilt
- Latitude
- Longitude

---

## 6. Handling Missing Values
- Filled missing values in count-based columns (Distance, Bedroom2, Bathroom, Car)
  using **0**
- Filled missing values in continuous columns (Landsize, BuildingArea) using **Mean**

---

## 7. Feature Engineering
- Converted categorical variables into numerical form using **dummy encoding**
- Ensured all features are machine learning compatible
- Avoided multicollinearity by dropping first dummy variable

---

## 8. Data Distribution & Patterns
- Higher number of rooms generally increases house price
- Houses closer to CBD tend to have higher prices
- Larger land size positively impacts house value
- Outliers observed in price and land size

---

## 9. Key Insights
- Distance from CBD is a strong price indicator
- Property size significantly affects price
- Categorical features like region and property type influence pricing

---

## 10. Conclusion
EDA helped in identifying important patterns, cleaning the data, and preparing
the dataset for machine learning models. The cleaned dataset is suitable for
regression modeling.
